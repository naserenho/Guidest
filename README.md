## Guidest project
Guidest.ae is a website/platform that gathers up everything in the UAE that is related to living in it, whether it is houses, schools, activities, jobs and more. It is custom made to gather up everything trending in the UAE from apps to shops to websites to events, to help spread the knowledge to lead a better life.  In other words, it's *Your local life guide*.
